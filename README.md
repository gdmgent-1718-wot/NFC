Installation
------------
You need to set up your development environment before you can do anything. Install [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) if they are not already on your machine. Node-version at least `6.9.x` en npm `3.x.x`.

Installation of [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) globally.

```
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

Quick Start Angular Project
---------------------------

### Create a new Project

Generate a new project and skeleton application by running the following commands:

```
ng new nfc-app
```

It takes a while to install all npm-packages, so please be patient.

### Serve the application

Go to the project directory and launch the server.

```
cd nfc-app
ng serve --open
```
The `ng serve` command launches the server, watches your files, and rebuilds the app as you make changes to those files. Using the `--open` (or just `-o`) option will automatically open your browser on `http://localhost:4200/`.
